# Who we are?

 We are a group of youth that graduated from Information Technology Institute (ITI) from 3 months track of Geographic Information System (GIS)


# What do we want?

 This website from its name “Together to End Homelessness” aims primarily to spot light on the homelessness dilemma in Egypt.

Homelessness is really a serious social problem that has its reasons and bad repercussions that threatens any society. We need to combine all our efforts to help the homeless people and save them.

First, it’s worth remembering that this website has started only just as an idea for our graduation project from ITI. But then we decided to work together to make a huge difference and be a part of the real solution.

 
# How do we do that?

We apply some smart GIS tools we have learned by clever instructors at ITI to analyze the problem;
In short words we try to answer these questions:

- Where are the hotspots of the homeless?
- What are the factors may be leading some people to be homeless?
- And according to these factors, where are the most places at risk in the future?
- And how we protect these places citizens?
- Where are the suitable shelters for every homeless now?
- And where are the best places if we want to open new shelters?
 

# How do we collect the data?

 We get an old data for the last 5 years from The Egyptian Ministry of Social Solidarity:  " مبادرة أطفال بلا مأوى – كبار بلا مأوى" to make geostatistical analysis on the problem. Any missing piece of data we need, we assume it. We will update the analysis when we have an accurate data we are missing. We have just showed a sample analysis to show how the power we have when we relate the data to a map and how we can help the decision-makers to get the correct action.

For the present and the future, we do a wide long-term survey and we decide to use the same survey form to inform about any homeless case “the location of the case and his/her belonging category”

 

        You see a homeless,
    Be a part of the solution!
